    "New York city is one of the most popular tourist cities. The tourist population in New York has continuously increased in past nine years and welcomed approximately 65.2 million visitors in 2018, includling overall 37.9 million visitors who stayed overnight in 2018. When people decide to visit a city, usually the first step they will do is going to a website to reserve fly and hotel. Lots of visitors might want to book a hotel sorrounded by restoraunts near by, so they can have nice dining out, and taste different styles and delicious food during their visit in NYC. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is no even one tour website which helps visitors to find their most favorite neighborhood based on the restaurant flavors. For example, Booking.com is a famous website for booking accommodations. This website put together several menus for their customers to search different accommondations seperately. For example, if you searched hotels, you got a result of hotel list. If you want to know the surrounding accommodations, such as restourants and public transport stations, you need to do a lot of extra searches on other search engines like Google. \n",

Second, they might also want to stay in a comfort hotel which has a lot of restaurants in a walking distance, so they can easily have nice lunchs or diners in nearby restaurants during their stay. Furthermore, they might prefer some styles of food, for example, Chinese, Indian, or Mexican food. Third, they might want train station within walking distance.\n",
