    "New York city is one of the most popular tourist cities. The city's tourist population has continuously increased in past nine years and welcomed approximately 65.2 million visitors in 2018, includling overall 37.9 million visitors who stayed overnight in 2018. When people decide to visit a city, the first step they will do is going to a website to reserve fly and hotel. Lots of visitors might want to book a hotel sorrounded by restoraunts near by, so they can have nice dining out, and taste different styles and delicious food during their visit in NYC. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there lacks a tour website that helps visitors to find their most favorite neighborhood for their stay. For example, Booking.com is a famous website for booking accommodations. This website put together several menus for their customers to search different accommondations seperately. For example, if you searched hotels, you got a result of hotel list. If you want to know the surrounding accommodations, such as restourants and public transport stations, you need to do a lot of extra searches on other search engines like Google. \n",

    "This project will leverage foursquare location data and use ‘k-means clustering’ machine learning algorithm to build a recommendation system to help tourist to find their most favorable neighbohood to stay in NYC and explore the surroundings of the hotel based on their preferred features. "

First of all, since NYC is known as a famous congested traffic city, and its parking spot is always limited, this family chooses public transportation instead of driving. Second, they might also want to stay in a comfort hotel which has a lot of restaurants in a walking distance, so they can easily have nice lunchs or diners in nearby restaurants during their stay. Furthermore, they might prefer some styles of food, for example, Chinese, Indian, or Mexican food. Third, they might want train station within walking distance.\n",
